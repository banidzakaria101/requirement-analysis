# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction

This repository explores the concept of **requirement analysis** in software development.  
Requirement analysis is a key phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do.

This repo will include:
- Notes and summaries on types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Examples of requirement documents
- Tools and techniques used in the analysis process
- Sample project breakdowns for practice

The goal is to better understand how to gather and manage requirements effectively for building reliable software.

## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of understanding what a software system needs to do — from both a business and user perspective — before development begins. It involves gathering, analyzing, and clearly documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

### 📌 Why It Matters in the SDLC

Requirement analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's why:

- **Clear goals**: It ensures that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the software's purpose.
- **Reduces risk**: Early clarity reduces miscommunication, rework, and project failure.
- **Guides design and development**: Well-defined requirements serve as the foundation for technical planning, system design, and testing.
- **Helps with time and budget**: Accurate requirements allow for realistic planning, estimation, and resource allocation.

### ✅ Key Activities Involved

- Identifying stakeholders  
- Conducting interviews, surveys, or workshops  
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements  
- Validating and reviewing requirements with all parties involved  

Effective requirement analysis results in a detailed and agreed-upon Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which guides the rest of the development process.
