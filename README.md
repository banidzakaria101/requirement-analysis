# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## üìå Introduction

This repository explores the concept of **requirement analysis** in software development.  
Requirement analysis is a key phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do.

This repo will include:
- Notes and summaries on types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Examples of requirement documents
- Tools and techniques used in the analysis process
- Sample project breakdowns for practice

The goal is to better understand how to gather and manage requirements effectively for building reliable software.

## üß† What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of understanding what a software system needs to do ‚Äî from both a business and user perspective ‚Äî before development begins. It involves gathering, analyzing, and clearly documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

### üìå Why It Matters in the SDLC

Requirement analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's why:

- **Clear goals**: It ensures that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the software's purpose.
- **Reduces risk**: Early clarity reduces miscommunication, rework, and project failure.
- **Guides design and development**: Well-defined requirements serve as the foundation for technical planning, system design, and testing.
- **Helps with time and budget**: Accurate requirements allow for realistic planning, estimation, and resource allocation.

### ‚úÖ Key Activities Involved

- Identifying stakeholders  
- Conducting interviews, surveys, or workshops  
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements  
- Validating and reviewing requirements with all parties involved  

Effective requirement analysis results in a detailed and agreed-upon Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which guides the rest of the development process.

## üîç Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. Without it, developers risk building the wrong solution or missing essential features. Here are three key reasons why it's so important:

### 1. ‚úÖ Prevents Miscommunication

Clear requirements ensure that both technical teams and stakeholders are on the same page. It reduces misunderstandings and helps avoid unnecessary changes later in the project.

### 2. üí∏ Saves Time and Costs

Identifying requirements early helps catch potential issues before development begins. This minimizes costly rework, reduces project delays, and improves overall efficiency.

### 3. üéØ Ensures Project Success

Requirement analysis creates a strong foundation for design, development, and testing. It ensures that the final product meets user needs and business goals, which leads to higher satisfaction and successful project outcomes.

## üìã Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Effective requirement analysis involves several important activities that help ensure a complete understanding of what the system should do. Here are the five key activities:

- **üì• Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect raw data from stakeholders, clients, users, and other sources to understand their needs and expectations for the system.

- **üîç Requirement Elicitation**  
  Use interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops to actively draw out detailed requirements and clarify unclear or incomplete information.

- **üìù Requirement Documentation**  
  Record and organize the requirements in a clear, structured format (such as a Software Requirements Specification - SRS) to ensure everyone is aligned.

- **üìä Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze the collected requirements to detect conflicts, overlaps, or gaps. Create visual models like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or user stories to represent the system logically.

- **‚úÖ Requirement Validation**  
  Confirm with stakeholders that the documented requirements are complete, correct, and meet the business needs. This step helps avoid costly changes later in development.

## üìë Types of Requirements

In software development, requirements are generally divided into two main categories: **Functional** and **Non-functional**. Both are essential for delivering a complete and reliable system.

### üîß Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define **what the system should do** ‚Äî the specific behaviors, functions, and features of the application.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users must be able to **create**, **view**, **update**, and **cancel** bookings.
- The system should allow users to **search available dates** and **filter by location or service type**.
- Admins should be able to **approve or reject booking requests**.
- Users should receive **email confirmations** after completing a booking.

These requirements describe the core tasks and actions the system is expected to perform.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Non-functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define **how the system should perform** ‚Äî including quality attributes like performance, usability, reliability, and security.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should load booking results **within 2 seconds**.
- The platform must support **at least 1,000 concurrent users**.
- All user data must be **encrypted at rest and in transit**.
- The user interface must be **mobile-responsive** and **accessible** for screen readers.

These requirements don‚Äôt describe specific features, but they shape the system‚Äôs **user experience**, **scalability**, and **technical performance**.

## üß≠ Use Case Diagrams

A **Use Case Diagram** is a visual representation of how users (actors) interact with a system. It helps identify the main functionalities of the system and shows how different users are involved in various operations.

### ‚úÖ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- They provide a high-level view of system interactions.
- They help stakeholders and developers understand system scope and user roles.
- They serve as a foundation for planning development and testing efforts.

### üìå Use Case Diagram for the Booking Management System

The diagram below represents a basic booking system. It includes two main actors ‚Äî the **User** and the **Admin** ‚Äî and their interactions with the system:

# Acceptance Criteria

**Acceptance Criteria** are the conditions that a product or feature must satisfy to be considered complete and functioning as expected. These criteria define the specific requirements that must be met for a feature to be accepted by stakeholders, product owners, or customers. They serve as a guide to ensure that the product meets the specified requirements and is of acceptable quality.

## Importance of Acceptance Criteria in Requirement Analysis

Acceptance Criteria play a crucial role in Requirement Analysis as they:

1. **Define the boundaries**: They clearly define what needs to be done for a feature to be considered complete. This ensures that developers and stakeholders have the same understanding of the feature's functionality.
   
2. **Improve communication**: By providing a shared understanding of how a feature should work, acceptance criteria help prevent misunderstandings between stakeholders, developers, and testers.
   
3. **Ensure quality and correctness**: Acceptance criteria set expectations for what constitutes "done," ensuring that the product meets user needs and business requirements. They help avoid scope creep and guide testing to ensure the system functions as expected.
   
4. **Facilitate testing**: Testers use the acceptance criteria to develop test cases and validate that the feature works as intended.

5. **Support user validation**: By referring to the acceptance criteria, stakeholders can quickly assess whether a feature meets their expectations and requirements.

## Example of Acceptance Criteria: Checkout Feature in a Booking Management System

Here‚Äôs an example of acceptance criteria for the **Checkout** feature in a booking management system:

### **Feature**: Checkout Process

**Acceptance Criteria**:

1. **User must be logged in to checkout**:  
   - The user must be logged into the system to proceed with the checkout process.
   - If the user is not logged in, they are prompted to log in before proceeding.

2. **Booking summary display**:  
   - Once the user proceeds to checkout, a summary of the booking (e.g., selected dates, location, service type, price) should be displayed for review.
   - The user should be able to modify any details in the summary before finalizing the booking.

3. **Payment options**:  
   - The user should have multiple payment options (e.g., credit card, PayPal).
   - Payment must be processed securely, with sensitive data encrypted.

4. **Payment confirmation**:  
   - After a successful payment, the user should receive an on-screen confirmation message.
   - A confirmation email with booking details should be sent to the user‚Äôs email address.

5. **Error handling**:  
   - If payment fails (e.g., due to insufficient funds), the user is notified with a clear error message, and the transaction is not completed.
   - The user should be able to attempt the payment again without needing to re-enter booking information.

6. **Booking confirmation page**:  
   - After payment is successful, the user should be redirected to a booking confirmation page with booking details and a unique booking reference number.
   - The user should have the option to view or download the booking receipt.

7. **Timeout/Session expiration**:  
   - If the user takes longer than 10 minutes to complete the checkout, the session expires, and the user is logged out with a prompt to log back in.
