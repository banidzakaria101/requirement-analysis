# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction

This repository explores the concept of **requirement analysis** in software development.  
Requirement analysis is a key phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do.

This repo will include:
- Notes and summaries on types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Examples of requirement documents
- Tools and techniques used in the analysis process
- Sample project breakdowns for practice

The goal is to better understand how to gather and manage requirements effectively for building reliable software.
