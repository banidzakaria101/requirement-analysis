# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction

This repository explores the concept of **requirement analysis** in software development.  
Requirement analysis is a key phase in the software development life cycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, gathering, and documenting what a software system should do.

This repo will include:
- Notes and summaries on types of requirements (functional, non-functional, technical)
- Examples of requirement documents
- Tools and techniques used in the analysis process
- Sample project breakdowns for practice

The goal is to better understand how to gather and manage requirements effectively for building reliable software.

## 🧠 What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement analysis is the process of understanding what a software system needs to do — from both a business and user perspective — before development begins. It involves gathering, analyzing, and clearly documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders.

### 📌 Why It Matters in the SDLC

Requirement analysis is one of the most critical phases in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Here's why:

- **Clear goals**: It ensures that developers and stakeholders have a shared understanding of the software's purpose.
- **Reduces risk**: Early clarity reduces miscommunication, rework, and project failure.
- **Guides design and development**: Well-defined requirements serve as the foundation for technical planning, system design, and testing.
- **Helps with time and budget**: Accurate requirements allow for realistic planning, estimation, and resource allocation.

### ✅ Key Activities Involved

- Identifying stakeholders  
- Conducting interviews, surveys, or workshops  
- Documenting functional and non-functional requirements  
- Validating and reviewing requirements with all parties involved  

Effective requirement analysis results in a detailed and agreed-upon Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, which guides the rest of the development process.

## 🔍 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a vital role in the success of any software project. Without it, developers risk building the wrong solution or missing essential features. Here are three key reasons why it's so important:

### 1. ✅ Prevents Miscommunication

Clear requirements ensure that both technical teams and stakeholders are on the same page. It reduces misunderstandings and helps avoid unnecessary changes later in the project.

### 2. 💸 Saves Time and Costs

Identifying requirements early helps catch potential issues before development begins. This minimizes costly rework, reduces project delays, and improves overall efficiency.

### 3. 🎯 Ensures Project Success

Requirement analysis creates a strong foundation for design, development, and testing. It ensures that the final product meets user needs and business goals, which leads to higher satisfaction and successful project outcomes.

## 📋 Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Effective requirement analysis involves several important activities that help ensure a complete understanding of what the system should do. Here are the five key activities:

- **📥 Requirement Gathering**  
  Collect raw data from stakeholders, clients, users, and other sources to understand their needs and expectations for the system.

- **🔍 Requirement Elicitation**  
  Use interviews, surveys, observations, and workshops to actively draw out detailed requirements and clarify unclear or incomplete information.

- **📝 Requirement Documentation**  
  Record and organize the requirements in a clear, structured format (such as a Software Requirements Specification - SRS) to ensure everyone is aligned.

- **📊 Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Analyze the collected requirements to detect conflicts, overlaps, or gaps. Create visual models like use case diagrams, data flow diagrams, or user stories to represent the system logically.

- **✅ Requirement Validation**  
  Confirm with stakeholders that the documented requirements are complete, correct, and meet the business needs. This step helps avoid costly changes later in development.
